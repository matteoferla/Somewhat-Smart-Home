## MCP3008

I keep forgetting how to set it up.

It is SPI not I2C.

* Notch on chip is left
* Bottom are the analogue inputs
* Top first two are 3.3V
* Third and last are GND
* fifth (MISO) goes to the pin next to the black capacitor on a pin zero (GPIO09)
* 4th and 6th legs cross places:
* 6th (MOSI) goes to GPIO10 which is before GPIO09 (order of pins is GPIO10, 9, 11)
* 4th (SPI clock, `board.SCK`) goes to GPIO11 which is after GPIO09
* 7th can go to CS0 (GPIO08), owards pin to MOSI.

### Code

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mcp3xxx
    
To read:

    import busio
    import digitalio
    import board
    import adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 as MCP
    from adafruit_mcp3xxx.analog_in import AnalogIn
    
    spi = busio.SPI(clock=board.SCK, MISO=board.MISO, MOSI=board.MOSI)
    cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)
    mcp = MCP.MCP3008(spi, cs)
    
Any of the pins can be read with `AnalogIn(mcp, MCP.P0)`, which does NOT support context manager.

## Sound monitor

Live sound monitor on the small ssd1306 I2C display from a MAX9814, which has written on it the V drop of 1.25 and 2 V max.
