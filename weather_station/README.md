The weather station is Pi Zero W, solar panel, 5,000 mAh battery and Hall transistors in 3D printed parts.
It is a failure due to the moving parts.

Rain gauge has a bucket of volume of circa 8.5 ml.
1 litre in 1 m2 = 1 mm of rain. This is not a time frequency, so normally has a window specified.
Area in m2, 9 cm diameter is 63.615 cm2, which is 63.615E-4 m2. 8.5 ml is 8.5E-3 ml.

Aenometer has axial radius of 7 cm.
angular frequency (w) in radian per sec times radius in meters is tangential speed (v) in m/s
