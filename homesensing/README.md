* `homesensing_api.py`: For pis across house to send their data
* `homesensing`: For gateway pi

## Install

    pip3 install -e .
    alembic -c development.ini revision --autogenerate -m "init"
    alembic -c development.ini upgrade head
    python3 app.py --d
    
Prod setup:

## Database

There are three tables.

* Measurment â€”each entry is a sensor measurement at a given time
* Photo â€”each entry is a path to a photo (from a "sensor" (camera) at a given time)
* Details â€”each entry is the unique details for a sensor
    
## Routes

Webpage is for viewing API for adding.
Adding only works if one has the key.
fail2ban jail need to be configure to jail excessive 404 triggerers.

### Adding data

The file `homesensing/homesensing_api.py` contains a class that can add data to the server.

But the key part is that `/record` route requires the following:

    {'key': 'ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾',
    'datetime': dt.datetime.now().isoformat(), # optional.
    'sensor': 'ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾',
    'value': 'ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾'}
